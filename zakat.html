              <h3>Zakat-ul-Fitr</h3>
              <h5>$13 per person by Eid</h5>
              <h6>"Keep up the prayer and pay the prescribed alms. Whatever good you store up for yourselves, you will find it with God: He sees everything you do."<em> Holy Quran 2:110</em></h6>
              <strong>Who needs to pay Zakat-ul-Fitr</strong>? "Ibn ’Abbas (RAA) narrated, ‘The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) enjoined Zakat-ul-fitr on the one who fasts (i.e. fasted during the month of Ramadan) to purify him from any indecent act or speech and for the purpose of providing food for the needy. It is accepted as Zakah for the person who pays it before the Eid prayer and it is Sadaqah (i.e. voluntary charity) for the person who pays it after the Eid prayer."
