          <h2>Ramadan Mubarak!</h2>
          <p>In this trying time, I begin by praying for your safety, for your families, our community, and all humanity &ndash; may Allah lift this tribulation, grant us all patience and steadfastness, and cause it to be a source of nearness to Him. Further, I wish to sincerely appreciate the great honor of serving you alongside our incredible staff and dedicated volunteers. At a time when we are all consumed with the impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic on our lives, you have never wavered in supporting our beloved Islamic Association of Raleigh with your time, donations, contributions, and duaa. May Allah accept in your scales and make it a source of continuous good for you and your families, <em>ameen</em>.</p>

               <p>Even as our doors are closed, we are offering the <strong>most extensive lineup of Ramadan programming in IAR history</strong> to help you experience energizing worship, community solidarity, and a vibrant connection with Allah (swt). We encourage you to orient your day with us. After iftar each day, join us in our &ldquo;100 <em>Taraweeh, 500 Khatma</em>&rdquo; program. If you can comfortably read from the Quran in Arabic, join your family in offering 2, 4, or more <em>raka&rsquo;at</em> of Taraweeh in your home after Isha prayers with any part of the Quran. Or, each night in Ramadan you can enliven your home with the Quran by <a href="https://raleighmasjid.org/imamscorner/taraweeh.html">tuning in</a> to a livecast of taraweeh offered our esteemed Sh. Mohamed Badawy, Sh. Hoosain Dalvi, along with <em>huffaz</em> graduates from An-Noor Quran Academy. (This will not serve as <em>salah</em>, but as listening &amp; studying the Quran from our homes). Every night at 10:30pm, whether you&rsquo;re praying at home or joining us on the webcast, join us for our nightly <a href="https://raleighmasjid.org/imamscorner/taraweeh.html">khatera</a> program sharing inspiring stories of strength in hard times from our tradition. Each week, gather your family at 1:30pm on Friday to watch our Jumuah Reminder and connect with your community. To receive a full calendar of our many programs, from a Ramadan planning workshop to daily spiritual <em>duaa</em> &amp; <em>dhikr</em>, sign up for our <a href="https://raleighmasjid.org/lists/signup.html">email list</a> to receive a downloadable calendar later this week.</p>
