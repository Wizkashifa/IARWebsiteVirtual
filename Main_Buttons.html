Congratulations on your upcoming marriage and we pray your union and your home are blessed. The IAR officiates marriages in accordance with Islamic norms and North Carolina state law.

Please note the following guidelines to help make your ceremony run smoothly:

Obtain a marriage license before the IAR marriage ceremony from a North Carolina Register of Deeds office. Additional information available at (919) 856-5460 or County Website (click here).
The following individuals should be physically present at the marriage ceremony:
the Groom & the Bride
(relative guardian) to her, serving as Wali (usually the father)
2 Muslim witnesses
The following documentations will be required on the day of the marriage at IAR:
Marriage license (the register of deed)
No Marriage is performed without valid Marriage License.
Photo identifications for the bride, groom, and witnesses
An agreement specifying the amount of the Mahr (dowry) agreed upon and how/when it will be paid.
Please note: Per IAR Policy, IAR mails the original marriage license papers to the court for final certification, and the court provides the official marriage certificate by the mail to the couple. 
All marriage ceremonies are performed at the IAR Mosque and are by appointment only.

Scheduling Instructions Due to our pending upgrade, we are only accepting Mondays and Saturdays appointments. To request an appointment, please email Imam Muamar at assistantimam@islam1.org.
